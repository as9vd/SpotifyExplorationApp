                This is the start. I've decided to make the app.
                A couple of things have been on my mind the last few months, but I really, really want to work on making
                something great.
                And this is what I've chosen. Put it all in.
                Can't take the mick anymore. I used the last few months to focus on work. Now, school's back in session,
                and I feel like it
                won't be too intensive. I might read this back in a few months, cringing at my lack of foresight (if
                Operating Systems and co.
                prove to be a pain in the neck), but hopefully not.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Anyway, I've sketched out a simple diagram and drafted a list of requirements. Time to focus, and, as my
                mate Pryce says, just do it.
                Tune out the outside noise.
                Too many people who know nowt about the art of building and/or striving towards greatness have been
                trying to take my focus.
                So much in the last 6 months. Like BJ the Chicago Kid says, I just have to hocus pocus and separate from
                the unnecessary.
                Let's do it. I've got the belief, so I'm already halfway there. I just know, if I keep going, I can make
                something incredible, something
                beyond the capabilities of most. Not just because I'm the only one putting in the work, but because I
                honestly think I'm at a really, really
                high level. But, sod whatever anyone else is doing; I gotta just focus on me.

                I'm hoping this application will improve my ear, desspite of this minging tinnitus. I will keep it in
                check, though.
                I remember, during that 2-week period of working in Bloomingdales's warehouse, I discovered SAINt JHN,
                Fivio Foreign,
                Live Life Fast (Roddy Ricch), and Kiss Land (The Weeknd). During the pandemic, even though times were
                tough,
                I used the opportunity to discover a lot of new artists/albums. I've been so bloody busy the past 2
                years,
                however, so it all fell off. This is my attempt at fixing things up a bit, because listening to the same
                300 songs cannae be good.
                Missing out on so much.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Anyway. Let's learn some key AWS (feels gramatically incorrect typing that, but somehow it's not).
                Let's learn Golang and some form of concurrency.
                Let's use SQL. Let's use Kotlin as well, somehow, although I might have to ditch the Golang idea.
                Let's use some advanced CSS/HTML concepts for this write-up nonsense. I like the minimalistic approach,
                but it's good to learn new things.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I think that's it. I'm ready. I'll be reading whilst working on this.
                This is the start of something special.
                Hopefully, this'll be my primary focus this semester, but things change, as Jason Fried told me on
                Rework. Let's do it.
                As Drake (üêê) said, for the young G's out here starting from the beginning,
                nobody praying for you when you winning, don't forget it.
